Netflix User Retention and Churn Prediction Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s userbase to uncover insights related to customer churn, revenue impact, device usage, and predictive modeling. The goal is to identify at-risk users, reduce churn, and improve retention strategies to maximize user engagement and revenue.

Key Features

	1.	Churn Analysis:
	•	Investigated churn rates by subscription type, country, and device.
	•	Identified segments with high churn and revenue loss potential.
	2.	Revenue Impact:
	•	Assessed total revenue lost due to churn.
	•	Highlighted opportunities to recover lost revenue through retention efforts.
	3.	Device Usage:
	•	Analyzed how users access Netflix via different devices (Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, Smart TVs).
	•	Uncovered device-specific patterns contributing to churn.
	4.	Time-Based Trends:
	•	Explored user growth and payment trends over time.
	•	Detected periods of significant user activity and revenue dips.
	5.	Churn Prediction:
	•	Developed a churn prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier.
	•	Predicted which users are most likely to churn based on user behavior, payment history, and device preferences.

Technologies Used

	•	Python:
	•	Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
	•	Jupyter Notebooks: For analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Dataset

The dataset includes the following key fields:

	•	User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
	•	Subscription Type: (Basic, Standard, Premium).
	•	Monthly Revenue: Monthly revenue generated by each user.
	•	Join Date: Date the user joined Netflix.
	•	Last Payment Date: The date of the user’s last payment.
	•	Country: User’s country.
	•	Age: User’s age.
	•	Device: The device used to access Netflix (Smartphone, Tablet, etc.).
	•	Plan Duration: The duration of the user’s subscription.

Key Insights

	•	High churn rates were found across all subscription tiers, with Premium users contributing the most to churn and revenue loss.
	•	Smartphones and Tablets were the most common devices used by churned users.
	•	Revenue Loss: Total revenue lost due to churn amounted to $31,271.
	•	Churn Prediction: Payment recency was the most significant factor in predicting user churn.
